## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Configuration Notice Still Showing
```javascript
// In config.js, ensure:
clientId: "your-actual-client-id-here", // Not empty!
// AND/OR
marketplace: {
    showConfigNotice: false // Force hide
}
```

### Collections Not Displaying
```javascript
// Check each collection has:
{
    id: "unique-id",           // âœ… Must be unique
    title: "Title",            // âœ… Required
    price: "0.01 ETH",         // âœ… Required
    priceInWei: "10000...",    // âœ… Required (wei format)
    manifoldConfig: {
        app: "0x123...",       // âœ… Required (app address)
        claim: "1"             // âœ… Required (claim ID)
    },
    enabled: true              // âœ… Must be true
}
```

### Mint Button Not Working
1. Check wallet is connected
2. Verify you're on correct network
3. Ensure claim is active in Manifold Studio
4. Check app address and claim ID are correct

### Network Mismatch
```javascript
// For Ethereum mainnet:
network: "1"

// For Sepolia testnet:
network: "11155111"
```
